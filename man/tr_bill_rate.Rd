\description{
These rates are the daily secondary market quotations on the most recently
auctioned Treasury Bills for each maturity tranche (4-week, 8-week, 13-week,
17-week, 26-week, and 52-week) for which Treasury currently issues new
bills.
}
\details{
Market quotations are obtained at approximately 3:30 PM each business
day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Bank Discount rate is the
rate at which a bill is quoted in the secondary market and is based on the
par value, amount of the discount and a 360-day year. The Coupon Equivalent,
also called the Bond Equivalent, or the Investment Yield, is the bill's
yield based on the purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year. The
Coupon Equivalent can be used to compare the yield on a discount bill to the
yield on a nominal coupon security that pays semiannual interest with the
same maturity date.
